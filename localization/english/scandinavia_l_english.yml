 federalise_scandinavia:0 "Propose a more civilized state"
 federalise_scandinavia.1.t:0 "The clan chiefs start arriving"
 federalise_scandinavia.1.desc:0 "The chieftain was sitting on his throne when one of the soldiers burst into the room and said:'Sir, there is an armed escort heading to the fortress! What are your orders?' Upon which the chieftain replied:'You shall welcome them, the clan chiefs have finally arrived. Prepare a grand feast.' After which the soldier quickly went away to prepare a royal welcome. The chieftain still siting alone in the throneroom started thinking about the speech he would give. After all it would need to be quite convincing. Never before had a federation existed in all of Germania and while the tales of the Mediterranean showed promise, it would be no easy feet."
 federalise_scandinavia.1.a:0 "Dinner is ready!"
 federalise_scandinavia.2.t:0 "The council convenes"
 federalise_scandinavia.2.desc:0 "After a large dinner with the clan chiefs, the chieftain was happy that the tribes were not fighting amongst themselves. 'I have truly civilized our nation, through prosperity, barbarity is made forfeit.' thought the chieftain to himself. But it was time to convene the council so the chieftain stood up and said:' Great chiefs of Scandinavia, it is my honour to convene this special session of the tribal council. Never before have representatives of all Scandinavia stood in one room without infighting and without crisis. Never before has Scandinavia prospered as much as it does now. But it is time, time to convene the council formally and get behind closed doors. As for why I have called you here, you will all find out soon enough."
 federalise_scandinavia.2.a:0 "A mysterious proposal?"
 federalise_scandinavia.3.t:0 "Propose the federal state"
 federalise_scandinavia.3.desc:0 "Once inside the chamber of the council, all sat down and with the blessing of the priest, the session begun. The chieftain stood up and went to stand in the middle of the room. 'Great chiefs of Scandinavia, this council has been convened by me for we have an important matter to discuss. We have brought prosperity to Scandinavia, trade is running through our cities as it has never done before. Our population has never been greater, our fleet is larger than ever and there is truly a unity between us. But with all these treasures that we now hold, we must also be careful. The southern Germans are eyeing up our lands, our tax collectors can barely keep up with the population and our trade is near impossible to regulate. And that my friends, is why I want to propose a solution that would bring even greater prosperity and safety. I propose that we create a federal state and abolish the old tribal chiefdoms'"
 federalise_scandinavia.3.a:0 "A man interrups"
 federalise_scandinavia.4.t:0 "The council goes mad"
 federalise_scandinavia.4.desc:0 "'You would wish to end this ancient tradition? You would seek to destroy the very chiefdoms that conquered Scandinavia under your family's rule? You would betray their legacy? While we have all heard of the tales coming from the Mediterranean describing extremely wealthy lands and efficient governance through federations. We cannot ever become them! They're selfish and care not for each other. The chiefdoms have kept us safe and happy for centuries and you wish to change this? You think we would hand all power into your hands; into the hands of a king? Never shall I support such a measure' proclaimed one of the chiefs out loud. But while he was putting his fury into words, the others in the chamber could do naught but freeze. None knew how to react. 'How could it have come to this?' they all thought. All were pondering about what to do and so the chieftain shouted aloud 'I will give you all a recess to ponder about what to do with my proposal!'. And with those words being uttered, many shot into action. Groups started forming and the council erupted into chaos. All shouting at each other as none could agree about the proposal."
 federalise_scandinavia.4.a:0 "This chaos isn't civilized!"
 federalise_scandinavia.5.t:0 "Temporarily in recess"
 federalise_scandinavia.5.desc:0 "While the chieftain had left the chamber, many representatives stayed behind to 'debate' and the 'spy' that the chieftain left behind in the chamber would observe and study the opionions of the chiefs. It was clear that 3 groups had formed. Those who would never agree to end the chiefdoms, the so-called Tribalists, those who would agree to modernize as the chieftains rule had brought upon their lands great prosperity, the so-called Federalists and then you had the group who simply were unsure about what to think. These groups were shouting at one another and little progress was being made but while they were debating, the Saxonian chief slipped out of the room and headed towards the gardens where the chieftain would be."
 federalise_scandinavia.5.a:0 "The Saxon has a plan"
 federalise_scandinavia.6.t:0 "The Saxonian proposal"
 federalise_scandinavia.6.desc:0 "The chieftain was walking around in his gardens when suddenly someone touched his shoulder. He quickly turned around to find that it was the Saxonian chief. He had come with a proposal. He explained that the proposal would never pass but that there was a way to make it so. The Saxonian explained that the chieftain could use the Saxonian mercenaries to force all tribes to accept his supreme rule and declare him king. But the chieftain quickly denied as he reasoned that a state held together in blood would never last. He had learned over the years that the best way to rule is to get the people to like the fact that you are ruling. The Saxonian reminded him that the proposal would be doomed and the chieftain wouldn't remain in power for long. After a small debate the chieftain returned to the halls. The Saxonian however dissapeared mysteriously a few minutes after. The man probably fled fearing the violence that would come of this proposal."
 federalise_scandinavia.6.a:0 "He's smart to run"
 federalise_scandinavia.7.t:0 "Reconvene the council"
 federalise_scandinavia.7.desc:0 "As the chieftain returned to the halls, he wondered if indeed the Saxonian was right. Would this proposal pass? Would it bring prosperity or violence? The chieftain eventually concluded that a federal state was the only way forward lest they remain in barbarity forever.."
 federalise_scandinavia.7.a:0 "The council convenes in  minutes!"
 federalise_scandinavia.8.t:0 "Iniate the vote"
 federalise_scandinavia.8.desc:0 "All but the Saxonians were present in the council and the chieftain was tired of waiting so they started the session. The leader of the Tribalists demanded to speak first and so the chieftain allowed it, not willing to anger them anyfurther. The Tribalist leader said that supporting this proposal would be an insult to their ancestors, to the people, to tradition and above all to the gods. He told the council that the gods created the tribal chiefdoms and under no condition must they undo the work of the gods for else all will feel their wrath. 'Atleast the Saxons were smart enough to flee from the divine wrath' he said. The chieftain interrupted and said that the gods did not create the chiefdoms, they created man and man created chiefdoms and as it is man's creation it is also man's duty to improve upon it. And about the Saxons he said that they are mere cowards not truly Scandinavian like the rest of us. But the time for speeches was now over as none would change their opinion now, the chieftain initiated the vote and..."
 federalise_scandinavia.8.a:0 "All in favor raise hands"
 federalise_scandinavia.9.t:0 "The vote is struck down"
 federalise_scandinavia.9.desc:0 "The result was clear. The proposal had failed, the unsure faction would not support a federal state and the Federalists did not have a majority of their own. The chieftain however would not accept defeat. He would find a way. He told all that they had made a mistake in not voting for the proposal as this was a unique chance to finally become like the great Mediterranean states. But slowly as the minutes started passing the chieftain became more and more defeated until he eventually left the council chamber. Unknown to the chieftains however he ordered the gates of the fortress closed so none could leave. He might find a way to convince them after all? Right?"
 federalise_scandinavia.9.a:0 "Know when you're beaten"
 federalise_scandinavia.10.t:0 "And know when you're not"
 federalise_scandinavia.10.desc:0 "After walking through his gardens, once more someone touched him upon the shoulder. This time it was his 'spy' that studied what the chieftains had said during the debate. The 'spy' informed him that the reason the unsure faction would not support the proposal was because they were afraid to hand power to a king, to one person. He said that they did not trust one man with so much power and thus the chieftain had an idea. The idea however would require a great sacrifice and the he wasn't sure whether it was worth it. But he said to himself that he governs for the sake of Scandinavia. That is what matters here. And so the council was to be convened for the last time."
 federalise_scandinavia.10.a:0 "A necessary sacrifice"
 federalise_scandinavia.11.t:0 "The council convenes once more"
 federalise_scandinavia.11.desc:0 "The representatives now weary of constant debate and a long day of whatever this mess was supposed to be, demanded to know why they had to convene again, right after the proposal was defeated. The chieftain answered that he had another proposal for them. He proposed make one amendment and hold the vote again. This amendment would be that the new federal state would not be ruled as a monarchy with him as king but as a republic. A republic in which no man holds power for more then a few years, he would merely be the first consul. He explained how this would make sure that never a tyrant could rise and like this no man would be empowered for long. And so he said that the council should vote upon this proposal at this very moment. No more fancy speeches and politics. Just a vote about the future of Scandinavia. And so with those words the vote began."
 federalise_scandinavia.11.a:0 "This should pass..."
 federalise_scandinavia.12.t:0 "That was to be expected"
 federalise_scandinavia.12.desc:0 "To the delight of the chieftain enough people were convinced by his practical abdication to vote for the proposal that a small majority was obtained. The new republic was to be enacted within the fortnite. But not all were happy with this result, those loyal to tradition and their ancestors considered this to be an insult and cause for revolt. The chamber erupted in violence as the Tribalists would under no circumstance accept to be ruled under a republican government, they would never kneel to it. The council started fighting and it grew worse and worse until one of the Tribalists accidentally hit a man slightly too hard with an axe. The man fell down dead upon the floor; the chamber was in shock, this was an act of murder, of rebellion and unacceptable to the chiefs who's friend lay now dead. The chieftain ordered the arrest but then to everyone's surprise no guards came in. A man went outside to check and... "
 federalise_scandinavia.12.a:0 "'Woosh'"
 federalise_scandinavia.13.t:0 "An attempted coup"
 federalise_scandinavia.13.desc:0 "Their it came, a Saxonian arrow in the head of the man. It took but seconds for the chieftain to realise that this was a coup, a Saxonian coup. The king fled as fast as he could as men poured into the chamber arresting all Federalists and neutrals. The tribalists where in league with the Saxonians, unhappy with the slow erosion of their culture thanks to the influence of civilization. The chieftain however managed to hide and run and his loyal spy managed to escape by horse to the local breeding ground where the cavalry was stationed. The spy rallied the soldiers to his cause on behalf of the chieftain and the cavalry charged to the castle in a speed never seen before thanks to the brand new roads the chieftain had ordered."
 federalise_scandinavia.13.a:0 "Those roads weren't a waste of money after all"
 federalise_scandinavia.14.t:0 "The cavalry arrives"
 federalise_scandinavia.14.desc:0 "The cavalry arrived only 2 hours after the coup. These were not normal cavalry however, they where the elite cavalry division the chieftain made sure to keep close to the capital incase of invasion. The cavalry quickly wiped out the Saxonian mercenaries who were no match for fully trained soldiers. The chieftain sprung out of hiding and with his loyal guard freed the Federalists who where taken prisoner and the Tribalists where all arrested for their treason. Their he stood, praised by all that he had freed for they owed their liberty to him. They did not know however that he hid like a coward and that it was in fact this loyal spy that really rallied the army. An innocent lie, i'm sure you would agree?"
 federalise_scandinavia.14.a:0 "Spinning the truth isn't lying"
 federalise_scandinavia.15.t:0 "You are in control"
 federalise_scandinavia.15.desc:0 "The chieftain stood once more in his halls. The fate of the traitors was in his hands and in a power move he personally took the sword of a guard and executed them all himself. He was in control, none could challenge him now, all those alive are loyalists to him. He could do whatever he wants with the nation now, his power was insurmountabke and the way he saw it. He had two choices, either he could follow the proposal that just passed and create a republic with him as the first consul but he could also declare himself the king and none could stop him. A few might resist but with the power of the other loyal chiefs at his side and with the dead of those who would most staunchly oppose him, it is doubtfull that there would be any resistance that he couldn't quell within weeks. So what will it be? A consul or a king? He stands infront of his throne and commands all to kneel, he opens his mouth and he utters the words... "

 federalise_scandinavia.16.desc:0 "The first consul of the republic went on a campaign around Scandinavia to show the people that they live in a republic. No more tyrants and petty squables between tribes. The time for technological and social advancement has come. It won't take long for the people to adapt as the development the consul had brought to Scandinavia in his days as king do not stray far from what a civilized society looks like. Everywhere the consul goes, he is greeted with cheer and respect, even in the Saxonian lands as they are just happy to not be driven out despite their betrayal. Once the king was done with his campaign, he returned home to a cheery crowd and he shouted the words now edged in memory and stone:'Long live the republic!'"

All men present kneel as the priest raises the crown preparing to put it on the head of the king, but the king stops him and takes the crown for himself and puts it on his head. 'Long live a new Scandinavia' he shouts.The king is now in power, he can feel the might of Scandinavia flowing through him. He stands here now and none can challenge him and those who would dare try would be crushed under his boot. Scandinavia is born again. Civilization is brought to the people and statues build all over Scandinavia. Never shall they forget the king who gave them everything in return for mere absolute loyalty."
